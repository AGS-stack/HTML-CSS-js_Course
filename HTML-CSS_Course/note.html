    <p>&#8226; flexbox is similar to css grid but it's more flexable</p>
    <p>&#8226; when we apply align-items : center; in the left section class in the header it doesnt do any thing and that's becouse the header is a flex-box but the left section still a regular div it's an element inside a flex-box to fix this we need to turn the left section to flex-box</p>
    <p>&#8226; CSS position is just the position property, the property "position: static;" is the default position it's the same thing as if you don't have this line at all</p>
    <p>&#8226; when we set position fixed it deesn't take us space on the page anymore </p>
    <p>&#8226; position property has four special properties we can use to move</p>
    <p>&#8226; special feature of 'top,buttom,left,right' of fixed positino element is that if we set it in opposit directions the element will stretch</p>
    <p>&#8226; the 'left,right,top,bottom' these properties pixel measurements defines the element position from the edge </p>
    <p>&#8226; position fixed = placed in the browser window while position absolute = placed on the page, check 5:09:32 time in the video</p>
    <p>&#8226; the element with absolute position appearing above the header element becsuse this element was written in our code below our header we can solve that using z-index property in header style for example</p>
    <p>&#8226; when position absolute is inside of position relative will be positioned on the element not on the page </p>
    <p>&#8226; the second thing that happens here is that position relative causes the whole element display normally</p>
    <p>&#8226; position relative means its relative to the container of it like if it's inside of an element then it is relative to it not to the page </p>
    <p>&#8226; stoped at 5:33:45 time of the video</p>
