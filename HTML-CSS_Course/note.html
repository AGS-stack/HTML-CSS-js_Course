    <p>&#8226; flexbox is similar to css grid but it's more flexable</p>
    <p>&#8226; when we apply align-items : center; in the left section class in the header it doesnt do any thing and that's becouse the header is a flex-box but the left section still a regular div it's an element inside a flex-box to fix this we need to turn the left section to flex-box</p>
    <p>&#8226; CSS position is just the position property, the property "position: static;" is the default position it's the same thing as if you don't have this line at all</p>
